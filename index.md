### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 part 2 was a favorite because of the Julian Day calculation. I just liked seeing (and writing) a really long formula. I didn't learn anything because I knew it all already, but the lab taught how to read inputs, perform long-form computations via coding, and returning the output of functions.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 is a favorite because of how fundamental it is. Reading inputs off of the command line is a fundamental part of the lab, and this was a lab I often looked back to because of it. I didn't learn anything because I knew it all already, but the lab taught how to read additional input off of the command line, and turn those inputs into a vector you can reference.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 1 was a favorite because of how tricky it was. The conditions were very tight and specific, and it was fun finding out how to translate those into really long, convoluted if-statements. I didn't learn anything because I knew it all already, but the lab taught how to write compound if-statements, and use the boolean data type.
